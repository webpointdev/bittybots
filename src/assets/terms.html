              transferable, and royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify,
              adapt, publish, display, and create derivative works based on the

                service that permits the display, purchase, and sale of NFTs, as
                long as such third party service cryptographically verifies each

              any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by this Agreement. In
              addition, you agree that you will not engage in any activities
              intended to disable, destroy, overburden, damage, or impair the
              website or interfere with any other party&#x27;s use and enjoyment

            <h2>7. DISCLAIMERS</h2>
            <p>
              Your use of the Services is at your own risk, and the Services are
              provided to you “as is” and without warranties of any kind, either
              express or implied. You acknowledge that the value of collectible
              blockchain assets is uncertain, subjective, and volatile. We
              cannot guarantee that your Purchased NFT has any inherent value,
              or that you will be able to resell your Purchased NFT for any
              particular price, if at all. Factors and circumstances outside of
              our control may affect the desirability and resale value of your
              Purchased NFT. Your Purchased NFT exists solely due to the
              ownership record contained on the Ethereum blockchain. Any
              transfer of your Purchased NFT is dependent upon the supporting
              blockchain on the Ethereum network, and not on our Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              You also acknowledge that we cannot guarantee that your usage of
              our Services will be uninterrupted or error-free, that defects
              will be corrected, or that any failure of hardware, software,
              internet access, or third-party unauthorized access will not
              adversely impact your access to the Services. Further, you
              acknowledge that we have no control over the risk of potential
              changes in the governmental rules and regulations related
              blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and NFTs in general.
            </p>

              Parties”) harmless from any breach of this Agreement by you. You
              agree that the Indemnified Parties will have no liability in
              connection with any such breach or unauthorized use, and you agree
              to indemnify any and all resulting loss, damages, judgments,
              awards, costs, expenses, and attorney&#x27;s fees of the

            <h2>11. SECURITY</h2>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to fully cooperate with any law enforcement
              authorities or court orders requesting or directing us to disclose
              the identity of anyone that is believed to have violated this
              Agreement. BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU WAIVE AND HOLD US
              HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY US
              DURING OR AS A RESULT OF INVESTIGATIONS AND/OR FROM ANY ACTIONS

            <h2>12. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
            <p>
              This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted pursuant to the
              laws of the state of Washington, United States of America,
              notwithstanding any principles of conflicts of law. Any
              controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
              or the breach thereof, shall be settled by binding arbitration in
              Seattle, Washington. The arbitration shall be conducted on a
              confidential basis and administered by the American Arbitration
              Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules.
              The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and any
              judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in
              any court having jurisdiction thereof.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any part of this Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable,
              that part will be deemed severable, and will not affect the
              validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. You agree
              that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
              relationship exists between you and us as a result of this
              Agreement or use of the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us
              relating to this subject matter and supersedes all prior or
              contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic,
              oral, or written.
            </p>
            <p>
              A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in
              electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative
              proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same
              extent and subject to the same conditions as other business
              documents and records originally generated and maintained in
              printed form.
            </p>
            <p>
