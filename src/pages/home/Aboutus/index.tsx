            ). We‚Äôre a two-person team that code and create experimental art. We
            ‚ù§Ô∏è crypto, NFTs, and Bomberman. Through the years we‚Äôve become good
            friends that have bonded over a love of traveling ‚úàÔ∏è, boardgames üé≤
            and foods üçú.

            New to the NFT world, and inspired by @ChubbiesNFT, @_kixboy had the
            idea of creating something from his childhood drawings‚Äîthus,
            BittyBots were born. The idea was formed back in April 2021, but at
            that time @_solazy had prior commitments to Chubbies. By giving back
            to Chubbies owners 1 to 1, our priorities aligned and we have set
            forth to create a one-of-a-kind collection that no one has done
            before.
