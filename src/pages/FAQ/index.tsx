            <PolygonContent>
              Polygon is Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum and a fantastic
              choice for our NFT. Polygon is very fast and scalable, enabling
              gas fee of ~$0.01 or less, which is crucial for this project as we
              do 10X more on the contract compared to other projects.

              It's a little complicated but please bear with us. First, you need
              to understand that ETH and MATIC can be on different chains. In
              order to purchase BittyBots on this site, you need to have{" "}
              <strong>MATIC on the Polygon chain</strong>. Once your MATIC is
              only Polygon, the gas fee becomes negligible.

            <PolygonTitle>What's an NFT?</PolygonTitle>
            <PolygonContent>
              An NFT, or “non-fungible token”, is a new way of collecting art.
              Compared to traditional art, it uses crypto technology and allows
              everyone to publicly see each others' collection. Each NFT has a
              programmable smart contract behind it that allows creators to do
              creative things such as airdropping, breeding, burning, or
              generating new tokens.

            </PolygonTitle>
            <PolygonContent>
              We wanted to create at least 10k tokens to reward the owners of
              the 10k Chubbies project. With the addition of the combination
              mechanism, some BittyBots will be burned and the collection is
              deflationary. This will make certain bots rarer than others, the
              collection size smaller and smaller, and in theory more expensive
              over time.

              Months of hard work have been put into this project—various
              original art concepts, solidifying a unique combination mechanism,
              and much more—and we are constantly brainstorming ways to provide
              more value for BittyBots owners. We wish we could say “the price
              will go to the moon!” but the truth is that the NFT market is
              volatile and new NFTs are coming out every day. We are not
              financial advisors and cannot predict the future price of our
              project. We believe in BittyBots and have plans to continue
              developing more utility. Ultimately, if you like the art then
              there's no loss in collecting what you enjoy.

              Our server needs to listen to the Mint event on the chain,

              upload them. This will take longer in the beginning as we are

            <PolygonTitle>How do I "combine" my BittyBots?</PolygonTitle>
            <PolygonContent>
              You can head over to the Combine page (when launched) and choose
              between 2 to 5 of the BittyBots you own, at a time. You will be
              able to customize a new BittyBot by selecting your favorite parts
              from the bots you have selected. This action cannot be reverted
              and the selected BittyBots will be burned.

            <PolygonTitle>Can I combine multiple times?</PolygonTitle>
            <PolygonContent>
              Combining selected bots is a one-time irreversible operation. The
              BittyBots used to combine will be burned to mint the new bot. You
              can combine bots up to 3 times.

              Can I combine into a BittyBot that already exists?
            </PolygonTitle>
            <PolygonContent>
              All BittyBots are unique. So you cannot create a BittyBot that
              already exists. The combination used for detecting duplication is
              as follows: Helmet, Face, Body, Arm, Engine.

            <PolygonTitle>What does it cost to combine?</PolygonTitle>
            <PolygonContent>
              The first combine is free of charge. The second combine will cost
              100 MATIC and the final combine will cost 200 MATIC. The second
              and third combine are only there for people who want to build the
              strongest bot.

            <PolygonTitle>When will the Combine feature be ready?</PolygonTitle>
            <PolygonContent>
              We will deliver this feature immediately instead of including it
              as a roadmap activation! If there are no technical difficulties
              (finger crossed), we plan to enable it as soon as reveal.
